# Web Performance Workshop

This repo contains the code used in my web performance workshop. There are many aspects of performance tuning covered in this workshop including:

## Server side optimisations
On the server side we will cover items such as:
* Using compression
* Handling caching
* Minification and bundling
* Optimizing code (using concurrency and parallelism)
* HTTP/2 push
* Using CDNs

## Reasctive performance tuning

Reactive performanc tuning is when you are constantly monitoring user's conditions and react to those accordingly to deliver a better experience.

In this section we'll cover:
* Resize Observer API
* Network Information API
* Intersection Observer API
* Page Visibility API

## Client side optimisation

On the client side, there are many opportunities which you can explore to improve web performance. We'll cover:
